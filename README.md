# Spam-SMS-Classifier
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to build an effective classifier that can help in filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful spam messages.
Spam SMS Classifier - Machine Learning Project
Welcome to the Spam SMS Classifier repository! This project showcases a machine learning approach to detect spam messages in SMS data. Below, you'll find instructions on how to get started, an overview of the project structure, and details on how to contribute.

# Introduction
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a robust spam detection system.
